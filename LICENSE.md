## 1. Disclaimer of Liability

The creator(s) and/or copyright holder(s) of this product shall not be held liable or responsible for any obligations or liabilities arising from the use of this product.

## 2. Mandatory Inheritance Conditions

<!-- Please link to the condition modules that must be inherited by derivative works. -->
- [RM (Reciprocity/Mutual Licensing)](https://github.com/ThePioneerJP/MISA-license-framework/blob/main/Default%20modules/RM.md)

Any derivative works or forks of this product must inherit the conditions specified in the linked modules. These conditions are mandatory and cannot be omitted or modified.

## 3. Waiver of Other Copyrights

Except for any copyrights associated with the mandatory inheritance conditions described in Section 2, the optional additional conditions described in Section 5, and any other additional conditions described in Section 6 and onwards of this license, all other copyrights associated with this product are waived.

## 4. Modular Extensibility

### 4.1 License Name Continuity

The name of any derivative license must follow the naming convention:

MISA-AA/BB/.../XX-aa/bb/.../xx-|xxx|

Where:
- AA/BB/.../XX represent the mandatory inheritance conditions, using uppercase letters.
- aa/bb/.../xx represent the optional inheritance conditions, using lowercase letters.
- |xxx| represents a brief description of the additional conditions not covered by the predefined modules, enclosed in pipe characters (|).

The name must be based on the "MISA" prefix and maintain an equivalent naming continuity obligation as the latest version of MISA-CLASSIC license for its own derivatives.

### 4.2 Existing Clauses Immutability

The existing clauses of the MISA license (Sections 1-4) cannot be modified. Any modifications or additions must be placed in separate sections (Section 5 onwards).

### 4.3 Optional Inheritance Conditions

Any optional inheritance conditions should be placed in Section 5. These conditions can be chosen by derivative works to be included in their license.

### 4.4 Additional Conditions

Any additional conditions that are not part of the predefined modules should be placed in Section 6 and onwards.

### 4.5 Modification Propagation

The modification and addition clauses (Section 5 onwards) can be further modified or extended by subsequent derivative licenses, as permitted by the terms of those clauses.

### 4.6 Modular Composition

When creating a new license based on the MISA framework, the modules linked in Section 2 and Section 5 can be rearranged, added, or removed as needed to suit the requirements of the new license. However, the conditions specified within each linked module remain mandatory and cannot be altered.

For derivative works:
- The modules in Section 5 can be freely modified, rearranged, added, or removed.
- The modules in Section 2 can only be added to, but not modified or removed.

### 4.7 Addable Components

Derivative licenses may add any components that do not conflict with the existing clauses of the MISA license. Some examples include, but are not limited to:

- Patent License: Grants users the rights to use any patents held by the contributor that are necessarily infringed by the usage of the software. Similar to the Apache License.

- Copyleft/Share-Alike: Requires derivative works to be licensed under the same or compatible terms. Akin to the GPL or CC BY-SA licenses.

- Source Code Disclosure: Mandates the distribution of source code along with the software. Found in the GPL.

- Attribution/Credit: Requires acknowledgement of the original creators. Present in the BSD, Apache, and CC BY licenses.

- Same License for Derivatives: Demands the same license to be applied to derivative works. Central to the GPL.

The addition of these components can bring the MISA license closer in spirit to other well-known licenses.

## 5. Optional Inheritance Conditions

<!-- Please link to the optional condition modules that can be inherited by derivative works. -->

Derivative works or forks of this product may choose to inherit the conditions specified in the linked modules. These conditions are optional and can be included or omitted at the discretion of the derivative work's creator(s).
